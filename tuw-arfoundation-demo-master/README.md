# Tutorial Project: Getting Started with ARFoundation in Unity



This is the completed project demonstrated in my ["Getting Started with ARFoundation in Unity" YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Ml2UakwRxjk).

Note, this Github repository uses Git LFS to manage large files. If you encounter any problems with files like images not working it may be because your Git client requires you to initialize Git LFS manually.

Unity version required: 2018.3 or later.
